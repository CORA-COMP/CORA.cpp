# Benchmarks

ARCH-COMP AFF instances of MATLAB CORA (`examples/ARCHcompetition/linear/benchmark_linear_verify*_ARCH23_*.m`)
in C++ and Python, on the same numbers. Each program prints the line of the MATLAB script,
`benchmark,instance,result,time` (e.g. `Spacestation,ISSF01-ISS01,1,0.42`); iterations, nrSteps and
timeStep go to stderr, next to those of MATLAB. `time` is `tComp` of `verify` (wall clock if it is 0),
as `savedata.tComp` in MATLAB. The MATLAB side is the original scripts, run from the CORA repository.

| family | instances | algorithm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `iss` | ISSC01_ISS02, ISSC01_ISU02, ISSF01_ISS01, ISSF01_ISU01 | reachavoid:supportFunc |
| `beam` | CBC01-03, CBF01-03 | reachavoid:supportFunc |
| `heat3D` | HEAT01, HEAT02 (HEAT03 needs Krylov) | reachavoid:supportFunc |
| `rand` | RAND01, RAND02 (`rand0?_test.json` models) | reachavoid:zonotope |

## Run

```bash
cmake --build --preset core                                   # build/core/benchmarks/benchmark_linear_*
build/core/benchmarks/benchmark_linear_verifyFast_ARCH23_iss [ISSF01_ISS01 ...]
PYTHONPATH=build/python python benchmarks/python/benchmark_linear_verifyFast_ARCH23_iss.py [instance ...]
```

The programs need `LinearSys::verify` (CMake builds them once `linearSys.h` declares it). Without
instance arguments a program runs its whole family. Compare with MATLAB by running the original
script in CORA (`benchmark_linear_verifyFast_ARCH23_iss_ISSF01_ISS01`) and diffing the lines.
`CORACPP_BENCHMARK_DATA` names another data folder.

## Data

`data/` holds the instances, about 0.7 MB in all, written by MATLAB:

```matlab
addpath('benchmarks/matlab'); exportBenchmarkData({}, 'coraRoot', '/path/to/cora')   % all; 'expected', false skips verify
```

`exportBenchmarkData.m` runs a copy of each original script up to (and, for `expected`, through)
its `verify` call and stores what it passed: nothing is retyped, so the numbers are CORA's.
Per instance:

- `<instance>.json`: `format` (`cora-benchmark-1`), `benchmark`, `instance`, `label` (as printed),
  `verifyAlg`, `tFinal`, `data` (the binary file), `matrices`, `specs`, and `expected`
  (`verified`, and `iterations`, `nrSteps`, `timeStep` where `verify` returns them).
- `<instance>.bin`: the matrices `A` (n, n), `B` (n, m), `C` (p, n), `R0c`, `R0G` (initial
  zonotope: center (n, 1), generators), `Uc`, `UG` (input zonotope, in the input space of `B`).
  `matrices` gives shape, `offset` (bytes), `nnz` and `storage` of each: `dense` is float64 row by
  row, `coo` is `nnz` int32 rows, `nnz` int32 columns, `nnz` float64 values (0-based), little endian.
- `specs`: `{"type": "safeSet"|"unsafeSet", "A": rows, "b": values}` over the output `y = C x`;
  a safe set must stay inside `A y <= b`, an unsafe set must avoid its intersection.

A scalar `B` of the beam scripts is stored as `B*I`; an absent `params.U` (ISSC01_ISU02) as `{0}`.
Unsafe sets with several halfspaces (RAND) need a `Specification` that takes them; the programs
stop with an error until then. Test: `python -m unittest tests/python/test_benchmarkData.py`.
